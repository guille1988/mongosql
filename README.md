# MongoSQL project:

## Introduction:

This project is a personal investigation related to the use, fundamentals and implementation of the Repository Pattern in a simple application made in Laravel. 

## Technologies used:

* _**PHP**_
* _**Laravel**_
* _**Javascript**_
* _**JQuery**_
* _**Bootstrap**_
* _**Docker**_
* _**MongoDB Atlas**_
* _**MySQL**_

## Fundamentals:

In my years of working on Laravel projects of all kinds, I've come to realize that this is a hotly debated topic.
All developers have very different opinions about the use, the implementation and if it is really necessary to use; the Repository Pattern.
I hope in this project I can demonstrate my point of view on this issue and make a contribution, however small, to our beloved community.



## Installation:

```php
composer require felipetti/service-layer
```
